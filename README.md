### Experiments

`GraphPrediction` contains the experiments for graph-level regression on ZINC.

`LearningFilters` contains the spectral graph convolution experiments.

The intrinsic neural fields experiments use private code from the authors of the [original paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.07967).

**Coming Soon:** More experiments and implementations of our models! This repo and our paper are still a work in progress.
